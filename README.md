## Project Aim and Goal

CertSecure is a comprehensive web application designed to provide organizations with a secure certification management system. The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Security**: CertSecure emphasizes security in managing certifications and domains. It implements secure password hashing, email verification, and uses industry-standard encryption practices.

2. **User-Friendly Certification Management**: The system offers a user-friendly interface for organizations to manage their certifications efficiently. This includes features like user registration, organization signup, and a dashboard for authenticated users.

3. **Domain Verification**: CertSecure incorporates a robust domain verification process using TXT records. This ensures that organizations have a secure and reliable method to prove domain ownership.

4. **Integration with External Services**: The system integrates with external services such as SendinBlue for email notifications and reCAPTCHA for form validation, enhancing overall functionality and security.
